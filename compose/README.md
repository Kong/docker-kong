# Kong in Docker Compose

The official Docker Compose template is [here][composer-url].

# What is Kong?

You can find the official Docker distribution for Kong [here][kong-docker-url].

# How to use this template

This Docker Compose template provisions a Kong container with a Postgres database, plus a nginx load-balancer. After running the template, the `nginx-lb` load-balancer will be the entrypoint to Kong.

To run this template execute:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

To scale Kong (ie, to three instances) execute:

```shell
$ docker-compose scale kong=3
```

Kong will be available through the `nginx-lb` instance on port `8000`, and `8001`. You can customize the template with your own environment variables or datastore configuration.

Kong's Official documentation can be found at [kong-docs][kong-docs-url].
